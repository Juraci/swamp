# Swamp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Juraci/swamp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Juraci/swamp)

Automatically generates the interfaces for the most common actions that a page can provide, 
so you can use the generated methods to quickly create your page objects using [capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) and [capybara-page-object](https://github.com/andyw8/capybara-page-object).

## How to install

It requires Ruby 1.9.3 or later and Firefox 24.0 or later. To install, type:

```bash
gem install swamp
```

## How to use

* In the terminal type: 

```shell
swamp
```
* It will ask you to provide an URL:

```shell
Enter the url for the page to be scanned:
```

* Provide a valid one, beginning with `http://` or `https://` for instance:

```shell
Enter the url for the page to be scanned:
https://accounts.google.com
```

* Hit enter and wait for the code snippets, like this: 

```shell
Enter the url for the page to be scanned:
https://accounts.google.com

Scanning, please wait...

def type_email(input)
  source.fill_in("Email", with: input)
end
def type_passwd(input)
  source.fill_in("Passwd", with: input)
end
def sign_in
  source.find(:css, "#signIn").click
end
def select_lang_chooser(option)
  source.select(option, :from => "lang-chooser")
end
def link_forgot_passwd
  source.click_link("link-forgot-passwd")
end
def link_signup
  source.click_link("link-signup")
end
```
(notice that the method names are a best guess and you are always free to change them)

* Copy the code snippets and paste inside your capybara-page-object classes like this:

```ruby
module PageObjects
  class SignIn < CapybaraPageObject::Page
  
    path ""
  
    def type_email(input)
      source.fill_in("Email", with: input)
    end
  
    def type_passwd(input)
      source.fill_in("Passwd", with: input)
    end
  
    def sign_in
      source.find(:css, "#signIn").click
    end
  
    def select_lang_chooser(option)
      source.select(option, :from => "lang-chooser")
    end
  
    def link_forgot_passwd
      source.click_link("link-forgot-passwd")
    end

    def link_signup
      source.click_link("link-signup")
    end
  end
end
```

* Then just call the methods passing the expected parameters when necessary. For instance:

```ruby
When /^I attempt to sign in with valid credentials/ do
  sign_in_page = PageObjects::SignIn.visit
  sign_in_page.type_email "username@email.com"
  sign_in_page.type_passwd "mypassword"
  sign_in_page.sign_in
end
```

### Dynamically detecting elements

* You can navigate in the browser that swamp opens 
* Lets say you need to log in to have access to some page 
* Just enter the url for this page
* Do the login procedure in the oppened browser manually
* Wait for the new page to load
* Then just go to the terminal and hit ENTER
* Swamp will detect the new elements (if any) and will generate the code snippets the same way as before

## How it works?

It uses capybara to fireup the browser and visit the target URL then it looks for patterns like:

* Buttons
* Fields
* Select boxes
* Input buttons
* Links

For each pattern found it verifies if the element is visible, has some key attributes like `id`, `name`, `text` and etc. 
There is some logic to decide on how to best create the method's name and the capybara's selector. 
Finally the code snippets are formatted and printed in the output.

Check the `.feature` files to learn about the overall behavior.
Check the `_spec.rb` files to learn about the internal behavior. Feel free to contribute.
